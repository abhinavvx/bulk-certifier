# bulk-certifier

A bulk certificate generator written in Node. The idea is to use a PDF template and an excel spreadsheet of participants, winners etc. from `assets/` to bulk export certificates to an `assets/output` folder.

## Inspiration

The inspiration of working on this idea came in while organising (HackNU 2.0)[https://github.com/hacknu2-0].
